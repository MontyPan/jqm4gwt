jqm4gwt
=======

JQuery Mobile wrapper for GWT is a project that wraps the JQuery Mobile framework into a library that can be used in a GWT application. This allows GWT developers to develop mobile web pages with all the benefits of jQuery Mobile without having to hand code javascript. In addition, projects that currently leverage GWT can add a mobile channel with ease.

This project is currently in beta release. The project does work and can be used, but the feature set is incomplete and there will likely be some public API changes.

Jqm4gwt also provides a useful form framework that enables rapid prototyping of form pages, including ajax submission and validation. See http://code.google.com/p/jqm4gwt/wiki/FormFramework
